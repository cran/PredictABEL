Changes in version 1.2-1 (2012-07-22)
   * Modified the reclassification function that can handle the zero observation corresponding to a risk category
   * Modified the reclassification function that can enable to compute the continuous NRI 
   * Modified the predRisk function which would allow to do prediction with estimated risk model on new data

Changes in version 1.2 (2011-10-19)
   * Added the function, simulatedDataset, to construct a simulated dataset with genotypes, genetic risks, and disease status for a hypothetical population, which is used for the evaluation of genetic risk models
   * Modified the function reclassification to include any number of risk categories
   * Modified the function plotDiscriminationBox which can include any continuous measures (risk scores/ predicted risks) to create box plots for cases and controls
